## Quote:
> I don't have such time to waste. One can think as much as he likes. However, I need to act and follow through with my ambition. Because we only live once, I want to do something that will be remembered in history. If I do the same as others do, I will never be able to make history. --- Masayoshi Son
> Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistake. --- Oscar Wilde
> Progressive Extremism: Instead of diet (time-based), criteria is picking sth. not hard to give up but give up permanently. Ex: giving up candy corn, and no sugary drinks at house ... â‡’ utilize self-image to boost self control. Ex: Vegen: they just don't eat, because they don't debate, don't spend will power on constant decision. Just don't eat rather sth. I can't do.
